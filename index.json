Although recent works have employed deep learning-based approaches to address the problem, they do not utilize spatial structural information within the images. This work investigates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to approach the problem. The object-centric features within the images are extracted using deep CNN-based models, which contain the structural information of the image. A generic baseline model is created and improved upon iteratively through structural data by constructing graphs and attention mechanisms on the graph edge connections. The constructed graph nodes represent the objects within the image, and the edge connections between the nodes represent the spatial relation to the objects. These graph embeddings are used to train our proposed Graph Embedded Memorability Model (GEMM), which shows significant improvements from the baseline as the attention improves the edge connections of the graph nodes. The model is then evaluated on the LaMem, SUN memorability, and FIGRIM datasets. Although existing state-of-the-art models perform well on one or two datasets, the proposed model generalizes over all three datasets with a Spearman's rank correlation of 0.71 on LaMem, 0.69 on SUN memorability, and 0.59 on the FIGRIM dataset. This model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance compared to the existing literature.","tags":["Deep learning","Computer vision"],"title":"GEMM: A Graph Embedded Model for Memorability Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jack Ratcliffe","**Nick Ballou**","Laurissa Tokarchuk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639008e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639008e3,"objectID":"0d0400674d84f312bdc0c2ab5c26ea85","permalink":"https://tahsintariq.github.io/example/2021-ratcliffe-et-al-actions.html","publishdate":"2021-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/2021-ratcliffe-et-al-actions.html","section":"example","summary":"Modern immersive virtual reality (IVR) often uses embodied con- trollers for interacting with virtual objects. However, it is not clear how we should conceptualise these interactions. They could be con- sidered either gestures, as there is no interaction with a physical object; or as actions, given that there is object manipulation, even if it is virtual. This distinction is important, as literature has shown that in the physical world, action-enabled and gesture-enabled learning produce distinct cognitive outcomes. This study attempts to understand whether sensorimotor-embodied interactions with objects in IVR can cognitively be considered as actions or gestures. It does this by comparing verb-learning outcomes between two conditions: (1) where participants move the controllers without touching virtual objects (gesture condition); and (2) where partici- pants move the controllers and manipulate virtual objects (action condition). We found that (1) users can have cognitively distinct outcomes in IVR based on whether the interactions are actions or gestures, with actions providing stronger memorisation outcomes; and (2) embodied controller actions in IVR behave more similarly to physical world actions in terms of verb memorization benefits.","tags":null,"title":"Actions, not gestures: contextualising embodied controller interactions in immersive virtual reality","type":"example"},{"authors":["**Nick Ballou**","Heiko Breitsohl","Dominic Kao","Kathrin Gerling","Sebastian Deterding"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634515200,"objectID":"534111fa1d721b0d5f5d0307b385727c","permalink":"https://tahsintariq.github.io/example/2021-ballou-et-al-not-very-effective.html","publishdate":"2021-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/2021-ballou-et-al-not-very-effective.html","section":"example","summary":"Effectance—the basic positive experience of causing effects—provides a promising explanation for the enjoyment derived from novel low-challenge game genres featuring ample ‘juicy’ feedback.

While they are frequently treated as a monolithic feature of games by researchers and policymakers, loot box implementations are not uniform: the features of loot boxes vary from game to game in ways that may have important consequences for player spending and behaviour. Despite this, previous attempts to classify loot boxes have either not focused on the impact of loot box features on player behaviour and spending, or have not attempted to fully map the different forms that loot boxes currently take. In this work, we attempt to illustrate the nuance present in loot box implementation in a featural model. Using our lived experience, a qualitative coding exercise, and consultation with an industry professional, we identify thirty-two features of loot box-like mechanics that might be expected to influence player behavior or spending, which we group into five domains: point of purchase, pulling procedure, contents, audiovisual presentation, and salience. Each feature is broken down into two or more categorization tags for a given loot box, and illustrative examples of each feature are provided. This work may serve to guide researchers in studying how different types of loot boxes may affect players, aid regulators in ensuring that any proposed legislation is sufficiently nuanced to handle the wide variation in loot box design, and help parents and players to better understand the inner workings of loot boxes during play.","tags":null,"title":"The Hidden Intricacy of Loot Box Design: A Granular Description of Random Monetized Reward Features","type":"example"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic 8-puzzle game.

In this study, we use specification curve analysis to examine analytical flexibility and the strength of the relationship between dysregulated gaming and well-being in the form of general mental health, depressive mood, and life satisfaction. Dutch and Flemish gamers (n = 424) completed ﬁve unique dysregulated gaming measures (covering nine scale variants) and three well-being measures. We find a consistent negative relationship; across 972 justifiable regression models, the median standardized regression coefficient was –0.40 (min: –0.54, max: –0.19). Data show that the majority of dysregulated gaming operationalizations converge upon highly similar estimates of well-being (i.e. have similar concurrent validity). However, variance is introduced by the choice of well-being measure; results indicate that dysregulated gaming is more strongly associated with depressive mood than with life satisfaction. Weekly gametime accounted for little to no unique variance in well-being in the sample. We argue that research on this topic should compare a broad range of functional and well-being outcomes, and work to identify a maximally parsimonious of dysregulated gaming criteria. Given somewhat minute differences between dysregulated gaming scales when used in survey-based studies and largely equivalent relationships with mental health indicators, harmonization of measurement should be a priority.","tags":null,"title":"The relationship between mental well-being and dysregulated gaming: A specification curve analysis of five gaming disorder scales","type":"example"},{"authors":["David Zendle","Rachel Meyer","**Nick Ballou**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588809600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588809600,"objectID":"5b78e5980d4842d046513dbcad4068c0","permalink":"https://tahsintariq.github.io/example/2019-zendle-et-al-changing-face.html","publishdate":"2020-01-04T13:58:37.322112Z","relpermalink":"/example/2019-zendle-et-al-changing-face.html","section":"example","summary":"It is now common practice for video game companies to not just sell copies of games themselves, but to also sell in-game bonuses or items for a small real-world fee.

Instead, a better way to do so is to programmatically generate it by passing some parameters to a code. Here, I discuss how to make a procedural terrain generator mostly using processing for python. This can also be done in any other language or game engine or 3D design software. I will be making a simple terrain using height maps for stylized purposes. But, first we need to understand how to generate height maps using perlin noise.\nPerlin noise is a procedurally generated noise texture developed by ken perlin. How perlin noise is generated using code is discussed thoroughly here. I’ll be using the built in noise function that generates perlin noise for processing.\nGenerating sample points In order to render the terrain, we need some geometry. We can generate tile the plane with cubes, but that would look more like minecraft. We could choose randomly generated points. But purely random or even pseudo-random choices have a tendency of clustering together. This phenomenon is known as Poisson Clumping. Pure or pseudo-random points are not good choices because of this phenomenon, as shown below.\nGenerated random points tend to cluster together. So, instead we use a different sort of random point generation called Poisson Disc Sampling. This generates random points at a given interval and thus making them more uniform. This is a much better choice for generating terrains.\nNow if we triangulate the points,We should get a plane with enough geometry to offset using the generated height map. I go into some details on triangulation here. The final result should look something like this (without the animation of course):\nCreating a rough 3D terrain Now we rotate the canvas on the y-axis so it looks more like a plane.\nThe entire plane rotated along the Y-axis to give it a 3D look Now, using the generated height map, we offset the z-position of the points by the value corresponding to that x and y position in the height map. This gives us a stylized terrain.\nA generated rough terrain We can change the shape of this terrain by changing the noise using offsets. This can result in traversing through the terrain as if we were flying on top of it, or changing the entire topology of the terrain. It will depend on how the noise is being offset.\nI’ve put the processing.py codes for this project here.\nSmoother surfaces The generated surface is still pretty low resolution and looks pointy. This can be solved in two ways. First, we can either increase the number of points from the poisson disk sampling process. The other method is using the Catmull-Clark algorithm. This is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to represent curved surfaces by the specification of a coarser polygonal mesh and produced by a recursive algorithmic method.\nFurthermore, the same process can be used to generate terrain in 3D modelling software. The Catmull-Clark algorithm can be used easily here as most software have built in support. The following demonstrates the improvements made while using the algorithm.\nThe left image shows a coarse pointy surface, the right image shows a smooth, curved, subdivided surface and below is an animated terrain made in Blender 3D Example videos Below are two different renders I’ve made using the processing.py. One with a half inverted render and the other colored according to the height of the points i.e. a topological height map.\n","date":1586908800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586908800,"objectID":"88d9dcc80c3ac0d69058e98bd58f0037","permalink":"https://tahsintariq.github.io/blog/terrain-generation.html","publishdate":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/terrain-generation.html","section":"blog","summary":"Generating 3D terrain surfaces using Poisson Disc Sampling","tags":[],"title":"Procedural Terrain Generation","type":"blog"},{"authors":["David Zendle","Rachel Meyer","Paul Cairns","Stuart Waters","**Nick Ballou**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579478400,"objectID":"d12588fb761ffbfee6c43bcb624f71a2","permalink":"https://tahsintariq.github.io/example/2019-zendle-et-al-prevalence.html","publishdate":"2020-01-04T13:58:37.320856Z","relpermalink":"/example/2019-zendle-et-al-prevalence.html","section":"example","summary":"**Background and Aims** Loot boxes are items in video games that may be bought for real-world money but provide ran- domized rewards.
